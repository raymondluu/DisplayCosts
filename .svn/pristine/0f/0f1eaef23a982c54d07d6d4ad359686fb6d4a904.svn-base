Modify this file to add answers to the questions below. Commit your modified version of this file to your svn repository for this project.


Most questions below refer to the Graph.pdf file included with the starter code for this assignment. Graph.pdf shows the same graph used in part 1 of this assignment. That graph is referred to as G in this document.

For questions 1 to 6 below answer TRUE or FALSE.

Q1.  Graph G is a digraph.

Q2.  Graph G is acyclic.

Q3.  Graph G is a weighted graph.

Q4.  Graph G is a complete graph.

Q5.  In graph G, vertex 1 (Aberdeen) is reachable from vertex 4 (Kennewick).

Q6.  Graph G is a connected graph.


For questions 7 to 11 below provide short answers.

Q7.  What is the cardinality of the vertex set (|V|) in graph G?

Q8.  List the vertices that are adjacent to vertex 9 (Tacoma) in graph G.

Q9.  What is the in-degree of vertex 8 (Spokane) in graph G?

Q10. What is the cost of the simple path {7, 6, 1} in graph G?


Questions 12 - 17 refer to DFS and BFS

Q11. Show the order in which vertices would be visited by a depth first search (DFS) starting at node 7 (Seattle). You may show either the node numbers or the city names.

Q12. Which previously studied data structure is used in the implementation of DFS? 

Q13. Show the order in which vertices would be visited by a breadth first search (BFS) starting at node 7 (Seattle). You may show either the node numbers or the city names.

Q14. Which previously studied data structure is used in the implementation of BFS?

Q15. Which search algorithm (DFS or BFS) is commonly used to construct a spanning tree?

Q16. Which search algorithm (DFS or BFS) is commonly used to find the shortest simple path between two vertices?


Question 17 to 19 below refer to the starter code provide with this assignment.

Q17. (Deleted)

Q18. In your own words, briefly describe the purpose of the minimalPath() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph.

Q19. In your own words, briefly describe the purpose of the floydShortestPaths() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph.

For questions 20 through 25, match the name of the algorithm to the problem in graph theory it is designed to solve (from the A to F list below). You may need to do a bit of research on the Internet to answer these questions. NOTE: below the list of questions is a list of various problems.

Q20. Dijkstra's algorithm.

Q21. Prim's algorithm.

Q22. Kruskal's algorithm

Q23. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm

Q24. The Bellman-Ford algorithm

Q25. The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
